I will not have time to apply the following method, nevertheles, I wish to present it here.
Regarding the commputation time needed to find minimums of the MLE, one should first compute the full LLH of the image, then locate the maxima with a simple np.max().
Then, one could use those unaccurate maxima as initial guesses for the fmin algorithm that computes the LLH functions and evaluate it at multiple points.
Then, ideally, since fmin returns decimal values, one could set up and use a super resolution algorithm to place the maximas in a bigger grid.
