    "Due to light diffraction, the resolution of conventional microscopic images is limited by the wavelength. Nevertheless various methods have been developed in order to \"beat\" the diffraction limit, especially in fluorescence microscopy. One of these methods is the photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM). This technique consist in isolating the observed fluorescent emitters and fitting their PSF. This way one can determine the location of the isolated emitter with a precision better than the Rayleigh criterion, achieving \"super resolution\". In this labwork, it is proposed to estimate the location of a given emitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity reasons and without any loss of generality, we consider the location from a 1D point of view. Let $x$ be the spatial coordinate, $\\theta$ the position of an emitter. It is then assumed that the signal given by this single emitter on the image plan can be written as $s(x, \\theta)=a r(x, \\theta)+b$ where $r$ is a Gaussian function centered on $\\theta$ so that\n",
